Thor Network-on-Chip
====

Thor is a Hermes-based (and improved) NoC implemented in VHDL.  

This repository contains the NoC itself and the input/output modules (in SystemC)
that inject/collect traffic in/from the network.
It also contains TCL scripts to compile and simulate with Modelsim.  

Thor is a highly parameterizable, clean and easy-to-understand implementation.
It's frequently checked for synthesis compliance and is coded in VHDL'93.
